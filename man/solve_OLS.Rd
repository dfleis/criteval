\title{Solve for OLS coefficients on a subset of data}
\usage{
solve_OLS(indices, w.mat, y.vec, intercept = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{indices}{A logical or integer vector of indices specifying the subset of
data (the child node) to use.}

\item{w.mat}{The full matrix of regressors.}

\item{y.vec}{The full vector of outcomes.}

\item{intercept}{Logical, whether to include an intercept in the regression.
Defaults to \code{intercept = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the solved OLS coefficients.
}
\description{
A stable OLS solver using QR decomposition. This is an internal helper
function for computing coefficients within a child node.
